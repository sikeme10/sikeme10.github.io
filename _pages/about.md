I am a Ph.D. student in Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. My research lies at the intersection of international trade, labor economics, food and agricultural policy, and food consumption and health. I currently pursue two main research agendas.

The first focuses on quantifying the economic impacts of trade policies and non-tariff measures, with particular attention to their effects on labor markets, especially in the agricultural sector. The second examines diet-related diseases and food consumption behavior, with an emphasis on how health shocks and policy interventions influence consumer choices.

Methodologically, I rely on econometric analysis and quantitative economic modelling to address policy-relevant questions, and I regularly work with large-scale trade and scanner data. Further details are provided on this page: [CV](https://sikeme10.github.io/cv/).
