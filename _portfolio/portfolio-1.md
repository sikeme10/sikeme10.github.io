excerpt: "Outside of research, I enjoy traveling and experiencing different cultures, having lived in several countries across Asia, Europe, and North America. These international experiences have shaped my perspective and inform my interest in global economic issues. I also enjoy playing badminton and long-distance running, and I value opportunities to stay active and engaged outside of academia."
